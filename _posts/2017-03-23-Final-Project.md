According to Crohnâ€™s and Colitis Canada, one in every 150 Canadians has one of the two diseases, among the highest rates in the world. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis cause ulteration and bleeding within the gastroinstential tract. This results in pain, cramping and diarrhea. Those who are affected can have sudden urges to use the washroom, from 5 up to 20 times a day. 

The objective of my final project [Washroom Availability in Vancouver](https://blogs.ubc.ca/vancouverwashroomsandcommuters/) is to look at Public washroom availability in Vancouver. Focusing on transit stops and their proximity to a public washroom. This will inform a map on Washroom Availability and areas where washrooms are needed.
