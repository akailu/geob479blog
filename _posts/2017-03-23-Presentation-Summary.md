####Predicting the Risk of Lyme Disease: Habitat Suitability for **Ixodes scapularis** in the North Central United States 

###### by Marta Guerra,  Edward Walker, Carl Jones, Susan Paskewitz, M. Roberto Cortinas, Ashley Stancil, Louisa Beck, Matthew Bobo, and Uriel Kitron


Lyme disease is one of the most common vectorborne diseases in the United States. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by *Ixodes scapularis*, also known as the blacklegged tick. In the Midwest, the distribution of Lyme disease is largely determined by I. scapularis. This species was first detected in Wisconsin in the late 1960s. The population expanded eastwards and southwards, remaining in relatively isolated populations. The white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginanus*) and white-footed mice (*Peromyscus leucopus*) serve as hosts for I. scapularis. However, it appears that the host population density is not what limits tick population, but rather the physical environment .

#####Site Selection:
Wisconsin: 28/59 state parks and forest were surveyed and selected

Michigan: three sites in Menominee , where ticks had been previously identified 

Illinois: sites in Ogle and Rock Island counties, sites along the Illinois River. 

#####Tick Collection 
The two dragging methods were used to tick in 138 sites in 1997: July, September- October and 1998: June and May. Along side obtaining samples from small mammals 

#####Sites the  were rated with data collected from the amount of ticks. 
* Negative (0) if I. scapularis  was never found on vegetation or small mammals host. 
* (1) if one stage of the tick was found, regardless of quantity. 
* (2) low density
* (3) high density 

#####Soil Date
Removal the layer of leaf litter, soil sample was collected
6 inches of topsoil
pH and the percentage of sand, silt and clay were measured for each sample = resulting in soil texture class

#####Forest Moisture Index
5 categories: dry, dry/mesic, mesic, wet/mesic, and wet 
Established through 50-m2  grid sample of each site 
Data Sources: 
Scaled at 1:40,000 from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) band 3 (red), 4 (near-infrared), 5 (mid-infrared)  and NDVI for hierarchies classification system into wetlands, urban areas, and upland areas. 

#####Landcover, elevation, and quaternary geologic data Illinois and Wisconsin and Michigan: 1:1,000,000 

#####For Statistical Analysis: 
1.	Univariate analysis was initially performed by using chi square contingency tables to determine significant associations between site positivity and environmental variables coded as previously described. 
2.	Discriminant analysis was performed by using only the significant (p<0.25) environmental variables from the univariate analysis (41). 
3.	Tick presence was positively associated with deciduous dry/mesic and dry forests, fertile soils such as alfisols, sand and loamy/sand soil texture, and sedimentary bedrock. 
4.	There was a negative association with grasslands and conifer forests wet and wet/mesic forests. acidic soils such as spodosols, clay soil texture, and Precambrian bedrock. Elevation was not an important discriminator in the model
5.	Then a logistic regression analysis performed, its results were in agreement with the discriminant analysis model in the positive versus negative group as seen. The same variables were significant (p<0.05), and the model correctly classified 83.9% of the sites. 

#####Results
A predictive risk map generated from the logistic regression model, sites in Illinois along rivers and farther south showed high habitat suitability (60%-100%) and Wisconsin moderate suitability (26%-40%) are located in the western half of the state. Patchy areas of higher probability (60%-100%) are found in the central and northern portion. In Michigan, where only a small area of the Upper Peninsula was sampled, all sites had very dense tick populations, except for a site that was classified as excessively drained (>99% sand). 

#####In conclusion,
 this model can be used to help determine the risk of acquiring Lyme disease and other diseases transmitted by *Ixodes scapularis* by predicting which locations may be currently infested with the tick. Show suitable areas where new population could establish.
