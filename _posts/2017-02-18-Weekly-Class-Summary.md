### Week 9: Is crime related to geography?
GIS not only allows law enforcement to understand where crime is occuring but also determine the spatial relation of crime across time. This week we looked at three theory from sub-discipline of Environmental Criminology, Routine Activity Theory, Rational Choice Theory and Criminal Pattern Theory. 

Routine Activity theory (RAT) believes that people freely choose their behaviour and are motivated by postive stimuli and avoiding  negative stimuli. An example used in class is: RAT predicts that residential homes are burglarized more during the daytime on weekdays and commerical properties in the nightime and weekend. As residential and commercial areas are restricted by bylaws, crime has a temporal and spatial pattern. 

Rational Choice Theory (RCT) states that offenders make rational decisions by weighing means and ends, cost and benefits to commit crime. This theory provides insight into the mind of the offender and why they commit crime.

Finally Crime Pattern Theory focuses on when and where crimes are committed. These three tenents of Environment Geography enable a better understanding of crime as a human phenomena. 


### Week 8: Reading Break

### Week 7: GIS and Crime 

One of my encounters with GIS was in the HBO show "the Wire". In the show a group of Baltimore police artifically deflate felony and murder statistic to maintain the mandate of crime reduction. The show protrayed how GIS is integrate in police activities from recording crime statistics (like in the show) to creating hotspot maps (like in our lab).  
A real life example of GIS and crime are mashups, menstioned in class, where Chicago police used Google Maps and Crime Stats to create a what crime looks like in Chicago area. Crime analysis combines qualitative and quantitive studies of crime with socio-economic demographics. A few types of crime analysis are, intelligence analysis (looking at organized crime), criminal investigative analysis , tactical crime analysis, and strategic crime analysis.


### Week 6: What is health geography?

Health geography is related to medical geography. However it is much more than that, this week we looked at the role of GIS in several areas of health geography. By examining spatial epidemiology, environmental hazards, modeling health services and identifying health inequality, we will better understand the nunances of health geography analysis. 

One of the sections, I found particulary interesting to learn about was epidemiology. How distribution and determinants of health and disease-related states in populations and how it can control health problems. The historic example Pellagra in the US was a good example of what epidemiology is. 

### Week 5: Presentation
This week, instead of lectures, we had an opportunity to learn the current GIS research through presentation by our fellow classmates. We each chose an academic paper which examined a topic in landscape ecology using GIS, for more information check out the Presentation Summary Page. 

### Week 4: Statistics: A review
This week was a blast from the past, from when I was enrolled in GEOG 374 Statistics in Geography. We looked at central tendency (mean and median mode) and multivariate statistics such as regression. There are many forms of regression in our labs we looked at Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model which attempts to minimise residuals (or squared errors). Spatial autocorrelation can found in a regression model. This is when, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) can be used as it accounts for spatial autocorrelation, and local variations, creating local models over a mapped surface (rather than one global model of OLS).   

### Week 3: Understanding landscape metrics: patterns and processes
This week, we looked at landscape ecology by understanding spatial patterning on ecosystems. 
Pattern and scale are central tenets in landscape ecology. In ecological data, spatial effects are scale-dependent existing between organism and space. Landscape patterns can be used for descriptive, prescriptive and predictive purposes. Processes (form) affect the spatial distribution. Types of processes are abiotic condition (such as: Climate, Topography, Soils), biotic interactions (Keystone species, tropic cascade and competition) and disturbances (ex: human landuse, fires volcanic eruption, etc.). Patterns and processes are important consideration when doing research and even policy making. For example: How will policy A impact the landscape differently than policy B? 

### Week 2: Why is Geography Important?

Issues such as:

* Scale, grain and extent of a study,
* The nature of the boundaries of a study area, and
* Spatial dependence / heterogeneity
* Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP),

are all geographic in nature. Thus we must use geographic data to study them. 

Scale is critical in analyzing data. Determining scale is most important in any research. Scale can be seperated into two categories: grain, the resolution of the data and, extent refering to the scope of the data. 


MAUP stems from the scale at which data is examined. Any data obtained is aggregated by a spatial unit, thus creating uncertainty. The data is generalization of the real world. The choice of areal unit can bring inadvertently affect or bias the end result. An example of MAUP is gerrymandering: a way of drawing electoral district boundaries to establish political advantage.

### Week 1:Introduction to GIS & GIS in Research
This week we looked at what GIS is? What are its applications?

Geographical information sciences (GIS) is the science of computerized data management, used to capture, store, manage, retrieve, analyze and display spatial information. Through patterns, processes, places, people, and perspectives, we will look research application in landscape ecology, health geography and crime. 

##### Ecology is 
the study of the interrelationship between organism and their environment. Hence landscape ecology is the subdiscipline of ecology which studies landscape structures and their interaction between organism. 

##### Health Geography is 
the study that looks at the interaction between space and health outcomes and health care delivery. Health Geography can be further seperated into disease ecology, health care delivery and environment and health. 

##### Crime Analysis is 
the process which looks at the effects of space on crime. GIS provides tools to analyse crime patterns and trend correlations.
